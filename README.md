### 2. Claude Code 

```bash
# Navigate to the maestro directory
cd maestro

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or with uv:
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Setup Your Learning Workspace

```bash
# Create your personal learning directory
mkdir -p ~/spanish-learning/{weekly_reports,practice_materials/{news,dialogues,exercises}}

# Copy the progress template
cp maestro/progress_template.md ~/spanish-learning/progress.md
```

### 3. Start Learning

Open Claude Desktop app/Claude Web or Claude Code and say:

Suggestion: Create a project and put all your Spanish learning chats in that project if you choose to use Claude Desktop app or Claude web.

```
"我想开始学习西班牙语"
```

or

```
"I want to start learning Spanish"
```

Maestro will automatically activate and begin your initial assessment!


### 4. Can i run this skill in other AI agent tools? 

Yes.

In tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini or their CLIs (Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, etc.), you can either:

- upload the entire skill as attachments, or  
- extract the `maestro` folder and point the agent/CLI to that directory.

For best results, use this skill inside features like Claude or ChatGPT *Projects*, which provide better control over context and conversation history.  

Claude desktop/web and Claude Code also support Skills natively and can keep this skill running with dynamic context management.

## How It Works

### Two Main Learning Modes

#### 1. Structured Learning
Follow the 52-week curriculum with daily lessons:
- Say "开始今天的课程" or "继续学习"
- Maestro loads your current week/day from progress.md
- Interactive teaching with practice exercises
- Progress automatically tracked

#### 2. Quick Practice
Practice specific topics on-demand:
- Say "我想练习在餐厅点餐" or "帮我复习subjunctive"
- Maestro adapts to your current level
- Uses web search for authentic materials
- Immediate feedback and corrections

### Daily Lesson Flow (30-45 minutes)

1. **Opening** (5 min) - Review previous lesson
2. **Objectives** (2 min) - Today's goals
3. **Teaching** (10-15 min) - New content with examples
4. **Practice** (20-30 min) - Interactive exercises and role-plays
5. **Closing** (5 min) - Summary and progress update

### Weekly Rhythm

- **Day 1-4**: New content + practice
- **Day 5**: Assessment + regional differences comparison

---

## Unique Features

### Dynamic Web Content
Maestro searches the web for authentic Spanish materials:
- Real restaurant menus (current prices!)
- Actual news articles
- Rental listings
- Social media posts
- Cultural events

### Spaced Repetition System
Built-in vocabulary tracking with spaced repetition algorithm:
```bash
# Check words due today
python scripts/vocab_tracker.py --due-today

# Add new words
python scripts/vocab_tracker.py --add "estar,ubicación,emoción"

# View statistics
python scripts/vocab_tracker.py --stats
```

### Regional Spanish Variations
Learn both Spain and Mexico/Latin American Spanish:
- Vocabulary differences: "ordenador" (Spain) vs "computadora" (Mexico)
- Grammar: "vosotros" (Spain) vs "ustedes" (Mexico/LA)
- Pronunciation patterns
- Cultural context

### Comprehensive Assessments
Every 5th day includes assessment:
- Grammar, vocabulary, fluency, comprehension
- Detailed feedback with specific examples
- Track progress over time
- Advance when ready (3 consecutive assessments ≥80/100)

---

## Expected Timeline

**Casual learner** (3-4 sessions/week, 30-45 min each):
- A1 completion: ~3-4 months
- A2 completion: ~6-8 months
- B1 completion: ~12-15 months
- B2 completion: ~18-24 months

**Intensive learner** (daily sessions, 1 hour each):
- A1 completion: ~6-8 weeks
- A2 completion: ~3-4 months
- B1 completion: ~6-8 months
- B2 completion: ~10-12 months

---

## Python Scripts

### Vocabulary Tracker (`scripts/vocab_tracker.py`)
Manages spaced repetition for vocabulary learning:
- Tracks when words need review
- Adjusts intervals based on performance
- Generates review lists
- Provides mastery statistics

### Progress Analyzer (`scripts/progress_analyzer.py`)
Analyzes learning patterns and generates reports:
- Weekly progress reports
- Identifies weaknesses and patterns
- Predicts level advancement
- Visualizes learning curve

### Content Fetcher (`scripts/content_fetcher.py`) - *Placeholder*
**Note**: This script is currently not implemented. Claude uses WebSearch tool directly during lessons to fetch authentic Spanish content in real-time. Available as an extension point for users who need batch content fetching.

### Practice Generator (`scripts/practice_generator.py`) - *Placeholder*
**Note**: This script is currently not implemented. Claude generates exercises dynamically during lessons based on your progress. Available as an extension point for users who need pre-generated exercise sets.

---

## Teaching Philosophy

1. **Interactive, not passive** - Constant dialogue, not lectures
2. **Spiral learning** - Assess → Plan → Teach → Test → Feedback → Repeat
3. **Practical focus** - Real-world usage over academic grammar
4. **Data-driven** - Track progress, identify patterns, optimize
5. **Authentic materials** - Current, real Spanish content
6. **Cultural competence** - Language + culture together

---

## Tips for Success

### Do's
- Practice consistently (even 20 min/day is better than 3 hours once/week)
- Speak out loud during practice
- Review vocabulary daily using spaced repetition
- Ask questions when confused
- Embrace mistakes as learning opportunities
- Use Spanish outside lessons (music, movies, apps)

### Don'ts
- Don't rush through lessons just to "finish"
- Don't skip assessments (they identify gaps)
- Don't fear making errors in practice
- Don't compare your pace to others
- Don't study only grammar without speaking

---
