Practice Generator - Dynamic Spanish Exercise Generation

NOTICE: This script is currently NOT IMPLEMENTED and serves as a placeholder.

Status: INCOMPLETE / NOT ENABLED

Description:
    This module is designed to generate Spanish language exercises including:
    - Fill-in-the-blank exercises
    - Translation practice (Chinese ↔ Spanish)
    - Verb conjugation drills
    - Mixed exercises targeting specific weaknesses

    However, the current implementation is non-functional. In practice, Claude
    generates exercises dynamically during lessons based on the student's
    current level, progress, and identified weaknesses. This real-time
    generation is more flexible and personalized than batch-generated exercises.

Future Development:
    Users are welcome to extend this script for advanced use cases such as:
    - Pre-generating exercise sets for offline review
    - Creating printable worksheets for supplementary practice
    - Building exercise banks for specific grammar topics
    - Generating exercises from custom vocabulary lists
    - Integration with spaced repetition systems

Implementation Notes:
    A complete implementation would require:
    - Exercise template systems with parameterization
    - Grammar rule databases for conjugation generation
    - Random but valid sentence generation
    - Difficulty scaling based on CEFR levels
    - Answer key generation and validation
    - Integration with vocab_tracker.py for targeted practice

Usage:
    This file is currently a stub. To implement functionality, refer to the
    docstring above and design your solution based on your specific needs.

    Consider leveraging:
    - The curriculum files (maestro/curriculum/*.md) for topic coverage
    - The vocabulary lists (maestro/resources/vocabulary_lists/*.md)
    - The grammar reference (maestro/teaching_guides/grammar_reference.md)
