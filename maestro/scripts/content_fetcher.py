Content Fetcher - Dynamic Spanish Content Retrieval

NOTICE: This script is currently NOT IMPLEMENTED and serves as a placeholder.

Status: INCOMPLETE / NOT ENABLED

Description:
    This module is intended to fetch authentic Spanish materials from the web,
    simplify content to match student CEFR levels, and cache results locally.

    However, the current implementation is non-functional. In practice, Claude
    uses the WebSearch tool directly during lessons to retrieve real-time
    authentic content, making this script largely redundant for the core
    teaching workflow.

Future Development:
    Users are welcome to extend this script for advanced use cases such as:
    - Batch content fetching for offline lesson preparation
    - Custom content curation and local caching
    - Integration with specific Spanish news/content APIs
    - Automated content simplification pipelines

Implementation Notes:
    A complete implementation would require:
    - Web scraping libraries (requests, beautifulsoup4)
    - Content parsing and text extraction
    - NLP-based text simplification (e.g., using spaCy or similar)
    - Proper error handling and rate limiting
    - Caching mechanism with expiration policies

Usage:
    This file is currently a stub. To implement functionality, refer to the
    docstring above and design your solution based on your specific needs.
