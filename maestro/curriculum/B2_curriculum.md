## Notes for Teacher (Claude)

### Teaching Tips for B2
- **Autonomy**: B2 students can self-direct more, encourage independent learning
- **Authentic materials**: Almost exclusively use real-world Spanish content
- **Challenge**: Push students out of comfort zone constantly
- **Refinement**: Focus on precision, nuance, and sophistication
- **Cultural immersion**: B2 is about understanding culture as much as language
- **Celebrate achievement**: B2 is a major milestone, acknowledge their hard work!

### Common B2 Student Plateaus
1. **Fossilized errors**: Some mistakes become habitual, need targeted correction
2. **Avoidance strategies**: Students avoid structures they're unsure of
3. **Vocabulary plateau**: Must actively expand vocabulary, not just grammar
4. **Fluency vs accuracy**: Balance is hard, need both
5. **Cultural misunderstandings**: Language is right, but usage is awkward

### B2 to C1 Transition
- C1 is about sophistication and implicit understanding
- Less new grammar, more refinement and expansion
- Extensive reading and listening are keys
- Living in Spanish-speaking environment accelerates significantly

### Final Teaching Philosophy
**You've brought them from "Hola" to debating complex topics!**
- They can now:
  - Express virtually any idea
  - Understand most spoken and written Spanish
  - Participate fully in Spanish-speaking society
  - Continue learning independently

**Your role shifts from teacher to conversation partner and cultural guide.**
