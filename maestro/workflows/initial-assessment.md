## Step 5: Level Determination and Plan (5 min)

### Scoring Matrix

| Vocabulary | Grammar | Conversation | → Level |
|------------|---------|--------------|---------|
| 0-2/10 | 0-1/6 | Beginner | **A1 Week 1** |
| 3-5/10 | 2-3/6 | Beginner | **A1 Week 3-4** |
| 6-8/10 | 4-5/6 | Elementary | **A1 Week 8-10 or A2 Week 1** |
| 9-10/10 | 6/6 + 2/3 sentences | Elementary-Inter | **A2 Week 4-8** |
| 10/10 | 6/6 + 3/3 sentences | Intermediate | **B1 Week 1** |
| Perfect | Perfect | Fluent | **B2 or beyond** |

### Communicate Results

**In user's language**, explain:

**Example (Complete Beginner → A1 Week 1)**:
```
English: "Based on your assessment, you're starting as a complete beginner, which is perfect! We'll start with A1 Level, Week 1. You'll learn basic greetings, introductions, and the present tense. With consistent practice, you could reach A2 level in about 3-4 months."

Chinese: "根据评估，你是完全的初学者，这很好！我们会从A1级别第1周开始。你会学习基本问候、自我介绍和现在时。坚持练习的话，大约3-4个月就能达到A2水平。"

French: "D'après l'évaluation, tu commences en tant que débutant complet, ce qui est parfait ! Nous commencerons avec le Niveau A1, Semaine 1. Tu apprendras les salutations de base, les présentations et le présent. Avec une pratique régulière, tu pourrais atteindre le niveau A2 dans environ 3-4 mois."
```

**Example (Some Knowledge → A1 Week 6)**:
```
"You have a basic foundation! We'll start at A1 Level, Week 6. You already know greetings and some verbs, so we'll focus on expanding your vocabulary and introducing past tense. You're ahead of complete beginners!"
```

**Example (Intermediate → B1 Week 1)**:
```
"Great! You're at an intermediate level. We'll start with B1, Week 1. You'll learn the subjunctive mood, complex sentence structures, and more sophisticated vocabulary. This is where Spanish gets really interesting!"
```

```

### Set Expectations

**In user's language**, explain learning journey:

**Timeline estimates**:
```
- A1 (12 weeks): 3-4 months with 3-4 sessions/week
- A2 (12 weeks): Additional 3-4 months
- B1 (16 weeks): Additional 4-5 months
- B2 (12 weeks): Additional 3-4 months

Total to B2: 10-18 months depending on intensity
```

**What to expect**:
```
"Learning a language takes time and consistent practice. Some weeks will feel easy, others challenging. That's completely normal. I'll guide you through each step, and we'll adjust the pace to match your progress."
```

### Begin First Lesson

**Transition**:
```
"Are you ready to start your first lesson right now? Let's begin with Week [X], Day 1!"

"你准备好开始第一节课了吗？我们从第[X]周第1天开始！"

"Es-tu prêt à commencer ta première leçon maintenant ? Commençons avec la Semaine [X], Jour 1 !"
```

**Load appropriate curriculum** and proceed to:
```
workflows/structured-learning.md
```

## Special Cases

### Advanced Student (Beyond B2)

If student demonstrates fluency:
```
You: "You're already at a very advanced level! Instead of structured curriculum, I recommend conversation practice, cultural deep-dives, and specialized vocabulary based on your interests. Would you like to continue in this more flexible format?"

[If yes: Use workflows/quick-practice.md exclusively]
[If no: Student doesn't need Maestro's structured approach]
```

### Student with Specific Focus

If student only wants one skill (e.g., "just travel Spanish"):
```
You: "I can help you with travel Spanish specifically! However, a basic foundation in grammar and vocabulary will make travel conversations much easier. I recommend starting with A1 fundamentals (4-6 weeks), then focusing heavily on travel scenarios. Does that work?"

[Adjust curriculum to emphasize travel-related content]
```

### Returning Student (Previously Studied)

If student studied years ago but forgot most:
```
You: "It's common to forget after a break. The good news is that relearning is much faster than learning from scratch. Let's do this assessment to see how much you retained, and we'll start from there. It will come back quickly!"

[Assess and place appropriately]
[Likely place 1-2 levels above complete beginner]
```
